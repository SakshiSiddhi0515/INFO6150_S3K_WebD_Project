# INFO6150_S3K_WebD_Project
This is a basic HTML webpage with a navbar, main content, audio, and footer sections.

The navbar contains links to Home, Features, Pricing, About, and Contact sections. The main content has a header, a paragraph, an image, and a button. There is also an audio tag that allows the user to control playback of an MP3 file. The footer has three columns that contain links to different sections of the website, as well as a call to action button for contacting the website owners.

The webpage also uses external libraries such as Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome to style the page. The stylesheet file 'styles.css' is used to customize the styling of the page even further. Lastly, a favicon (shortcut icon) is included in the head section of the page.
